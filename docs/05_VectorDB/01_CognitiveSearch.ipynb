It provides methods to access the OpenAI REST APIs for various tasks such as text completion, text embedding, and chat completion, etc.. It also allows developers to specify the model, engine, and options for each request, such as temperature, frequency penalty, presence penalty, and stop sequences. \n",

    "Technical facts are precise pieces of information or data related to a specific technical domain or subject. They can encompass a wide range of topics including software specifications, hardware configurations, algorithm behaviors, coding standards, or any other technical attributes and characteristics. These facts are typically derived from technical documentation, product manuals, technical research papers, or direct observations and measurements.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Knowledge Retrieval**: Quickly retrieving relevant technical information needed for decision-making, problem-solving, or understanding a particular technical concept or system.\n",
    "2. **Technical Support and Troubleshooting**: Assisting in identifying solutions to technical issues or providing guidance based on the technical facts available.\n",
    "3. **Product Development and Improvement**: Facilitating a deeper understanding of technical specifications and requirements which in turn can guide product development and improvement efforts.\n",
    "4. **Research and Innovation**: Providing a foundation for research and innovation by offering a rich source of technical data that can be explored and analyzed.\n",
    "5. **Educational Purposes**: Serving as a valuable resource for educational purposes, helping learners, and professionals to grasp technical concepts and stay updated on technical advancements.\n",
    "\n",
    "By having a semantic search capability on these technical facts, users can go beyond simple keyword searches and leverage the power of semantic understanding to find more relevant and contextual results. This makes the search process much more effective and insightful, especially in scenarios where precision and context are crucial.\n"

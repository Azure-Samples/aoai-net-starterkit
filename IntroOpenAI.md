# Introduction to Azure OpenAI

## Overview

Azure OpenAI (AOAI) is a result of partnership between Microsoft and OpenAI. The service combines Azure's enterprise grade capabilities with OpenAI's generative AI LLM capabilities.

Using Azure OpenAI allows you to transition between your work with Azure services and OpenAI, while utilizing Azure's private networking, regional availability, and responsible AI content filtering.

## Getting Started

### Overview

- **_Get Access_**: Currently you need to [apply](https://customervoice.microsoft.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR7en2Ais5pxKtso_Pz4b1_xUOFA5Qk1UWDRBMjg0WFhPMkIzTzhKQ1dWNyQlQCN0PWcu) for access to Azure OpenAI.
- **_Responsible AI_**: Usage of Azure OpenAI should follow the six Microsoft's responsible AI principles documented [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-responsible-ai?view=azureml-api-2). Refer to Microsoft Responsible AI [standards ](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/principles-and-approach). Also refer to Microsoft Transparency Notes on Azure OpenAI [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/cognitive-services/openai/transparency-note?tabs=text).
- **_Learning OpenAI_**: [OpenAI Learn Live - Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/users/kimberlm/collections/ke7xh43zn1w0k7?WT.mc_id=learnlive-2023228AFT) or [Azure OpenAI Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/).

### Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting well-structured and specific input queries or prompts to guide the output of language models. Prompts play a crucial role in communicating and directing the behavior of LLMs. They serve as inputs or queries that users can provide to elicit specific responses from a model. Effective prompt design is essential to achieving desired outcomes with LLM AI models. It involves selecting the right words, phrases, symbols and formats that guide the model in generating high-quality and relevant texts. Here are some links to get started with prompt engineering:
